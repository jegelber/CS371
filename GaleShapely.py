# Gale-Shapley Stable Matching Implementation

# This program computes a stable matching using an implementation of the Gale-Shapley
# algorithm. The program is given a user input in the form below:
# n
# mX wA wB
# mY wB wA
# wA mY mX
# wB mY mX
# Where n is the total number of pairs and the next n lines have each man's name followed
# by n women in the man's preference order then, the next n lines have each woman's name
# followed by the woman's preference order of n men.



# This function computes and returns stable matching between men and women using a dictionary
# of each woman's preferences in a dictonary structure, a dictonary of each man's preferences
# in a stack structure, and a stack of all single men.
